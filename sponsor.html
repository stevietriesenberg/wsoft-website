        <h>Our Mission</h><br>

        <h>Your Support</h>
        <p>At the start of 2020, WolverineSoft Studio will not even be a year old, yet its membership has
grown exponentially. In this critical period of growth for our student organization and the
Michigan games industry, there are a multitude of meaningful ways that you can contribute to
our continued success and expansion. Because we are a certified 501(c)(3) and a rapidly growing
group of young adults about to enter the industry, there are also many ways that we in turn can
return your generosity. Our student leaders would be happy to organize events in collaboration
with your company and discuss any other courses of action.</p>
